# Video Player

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project has been developed from Codecademy platform in the "Learn React" course.
All the media have been provided by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)


## Features

This app allows the user to choose a video type by selecting a radio button. 
Then the video matching the criteria is displayed in the video player.


## Components

- Menu with radio buttons
- Video player


## Technologies

React Version 18.2.0


## What I Practiced While Doing This Project

Use a classical React programming pattern:
- Child component (Menu) updates the state of the Parent component (App)
- Child component (Video) inherits the state of the Parent component (App)
